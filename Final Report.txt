<h1> PROBLEM and BACKGROUND DISCUSSION </h1>

Problem - The aim of the project is to predict the severity of a road accident using various attributes given such as road condition, car speed etc.

Background Discussion - We have a dataset of Seattle's car accidents provided by SPD. 
It has many attributes and we need to find those which have effect on severity of accident. 
Further, using these attributes, and there contribution to the severity we need to develop a model to predict severity of any future accident.

This can be used by authorities such highway patroling or by hospitals to strategically place ambulance. 
Further, it can also be used by public to plan their drive accordingly.


<h1> DATA DESCRIPTION </h1>

The seattle consists of 38 attributes. It has 194,673 data rows and each row represents one accident.

Out of 38 columns - one of them is the target label and remaining 37 are attributes used to predict the target label. Out of these 37 attributes not all will be used and only those important to predicting the severity of the accident will be used to train the model.

The label is denoted of SEVERITYCODE which is 1 for non severe accident and 2 for severe accident. Our goal will be to predict this once the model has been trained.

Some of the important attributes that we may use to create the model are:
1) Road Condition - Values of Road condition are shown below

Other                          235
Dark - Unknown Lighting         11

3) Speeding -

Remaining are NaN - We will consider it to be no

Blowing Sand/Dirt               56
Severe Crosswind                25
Partly Cloudy                    5


<h1> Methodology </h1>

Firstly we explore the data set by finding out correlation between the different attributes and visualising it using a heat map plot. 
This gave an insight into which datasets are important and which are not. 
Also, I was able to analyse that which attributes are related to each other. 
Some attributes are same as other attributes but just that they are written in a different way (example - description of a code)
In such cases we can remove either.

So, I decided to drop the following attributes
'OBJECTID', 'X', 'Y', 'INCKEY', 'STATUS','COLDETKEY', 'LOCATION','REPORTNO','INTKEY','EXCEPTRSNCODE','SEVERITYCODE.1','PERSONCOUNT','SEGLANEKEY','CROSSWALKKEY','HITPARKEDCAR','ST_COLCODE','SDOTCOLNUM','PEDROWNOTGRNT','INATTENTIONIND','EXCEPTRSNDESC','SEVERITYDESC','INCDATE','INCDTTM','SDOT_COLCODE','UNDERINFL'

Hence only the following attributes were used
'ADDRTYPE','COLLISIONTYPE','JUNCTIONTYPE','PEDCOUNT','PEDCYLCOUNT','VEHCOUNT','WEATHER','ROADCOND','LIGHTCOND','SPEEDING','SDOT_COLDESC','ST_COLDESC'

Next, we look for missing values in the above columns.
All the attrubutes had fairly less number of missing values except SPEEDING.
SPEEDING had 185340 missing values. But it was realised that all the values present were Yes and instead of No it contained NaN.
So I replaced all NaN with No in the SPEEDING column
For all other columns those rows which contained missing values were dropped.

Finally I was left with 182895 values.

Next, There is a data imbalance.
Number of data points for label 1 are 126270
and number of data points for label 2 are 56625 only.

So, I sampled out 56625 data points out of 126270 data points from class label 1.
So, now for both labels 1 and 2 there are 56656 data points each.
This forms the final balanced dataset.

Also, I replaced label 1 with 0 and 
label 2 with 1
So, now 1 means severe
0 means non severe

Now, most of these values are in form of text.
For example, weather has values such as 'Clear', 'Raining', etc.

So, we use preprocessing.LabelEncoder() from sklearn to encode these vaules into numbers.

Lastly, we apply standard Scalar to normalise the data.
This completes data preparation step.

We split the data into train and test set and train a decision Tree Classifier over it.

<h1> Results </h1>

Decision Tree classifier trained on 101925 samples with a maximum depth of 20.
F1 Score obtained was 0.680907372400756.

<h1> Discussion </h1>

No such unique findings were made

<h1> Conclusion  </h1>

Road traffic accidents are leading to an increased damage to property and cost to live.
Able to mitigate situations of a road traffic accident effectively by using data can be extremely helpful.
In this project I used several attributes that contribute to severity of a road traffic accident and built a model to make severity predictions for the future cases.
