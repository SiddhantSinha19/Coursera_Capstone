DATA DESCRIPTION

The seattle consists of 38 attributes. It has 194,673 data rows and each row represents one accident.

Out of 38 columns - one of them is the target label and remaining 37 are attributes used to predict the target label. Out of these 37 attributes not all will be used and only those important to predicting the severity of the accident will be used to train the model.

The label is denoted of SEVERITYCODE which is 1 for non severe accident and 2 for severe accident. Our goal will be to predict this once the model has been trained.

Some of the important attributes that we may use to create the model are:
